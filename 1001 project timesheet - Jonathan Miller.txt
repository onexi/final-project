2017-04-21
7-9:30am = 2.5 hours. Acquire materials
5-6pm = 1 hours. Define upstream data expectations with partners

2017-04-22
11am-1pm = 2 hours. Arduino coding

2017-04-24
9:30-11:30 am = 2 hours. Arduino work
7:30-9:30 pm = 2 hours. Tessel development

2017-04-26
6:30-9:00am = 2.5 hours. Tessel and presentation prep. 
>>Deliverable #1 submitted
Total hours to prepare this deliverable = 11 hours
------------------------------------------------------------

2017-04-29
7-9pm = 2.0 hours. Tessel development.

2017-04-30 
9am-12:30pm = 3.5 hours. Get familiar with servo and set up calibration 'jig'.
1:00-9pm = 8 hours. Calibrate servo, develop JS+python single-dimension interpolator.

2017-05-01
9:30-11am = 1.5 hours. Start MQTT development.

2017-05-02
8-10:30pm = 2.5 hours. 2-axis servo testing on Tessel.

2017-05-03
7-9am = 2 hours. Presentation prep.
>>Deliverable #2 submitted
Total hours to prepare this deliverable = 19.5 hours
------------------------------------------------------------

2017-05-06
3-10pm = 7 hours. Devised projector calibration grid. Built dual-axis servos. Developed independent controls for each servo axis. Mounted system. Performed calibrations between turret and grid.

2017-05-07
4-6pm = 2 hours. Worked with turret but having trouble getting control of second axis. Wiring is a problem.

2017-05-08
6-10pm = 4 hours. Pursued numerous (failed) attempts at translating from projected grid to 2-axis control parameters. Research uncovered that Iâ€™m attempting to perform something like multivariate interpolation on structured, unspaced data. Developed a computational cheap (and a little inaccurate) hack for interpolating anywhere along two axes.

2017-05-09
6-8am = 2 hours. Organized repository. Revised notes.

7-11m = 5.0 hours. Documented project and code. Prepared materials for submission.

6-9am = 4.0 hours. Produced final deliverable video. Prepared in-class demo.
>>Deliverable #3 (FINAL) submitted
Total hours to prepare this deliverable = 24.0 hours
